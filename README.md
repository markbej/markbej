- 👋 Hi, I’m @markbej
- 👀 I’m interested in - programming to make my life easier. Used to program significantly, now most of my time is taken up by my neurology practice and volunteering with the scouts, which entails various things from administrative paperwork to planning and helping with hikes and canoe trips to digging trenches for electrical lines, drainage, and various and sundry other projects almost always eventually involving dirt under fingernails and double-washing of jeans.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning - SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - nothing yet.
- 📫 How to reach me - email is best, mbej@nomshealthcare.com
